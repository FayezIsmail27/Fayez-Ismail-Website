                 <h2>My Volunteering Journey: Making a Difference in Communities and Robotics</h2>


                 <h3>Volunteering with NGOs: Empowering Communities (2019-2023)</h3>

                    <div class="first">
                <p1>From 2019 to 2023, during summer vacations and other school breaks, I dedicated my time to voluntarily assisting and working with various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These NGOs, both local and international, focus on implementing development programs to improve living conditions and support the Palestinian people in need. Through this work, I had the opportunity to attend and facilitate sessions and meetings conducted by these organizations with local community representatives. Using the Rapid Participatory Approach (RPA), we conducted needs assessments for each community, identifying the most suitable development programs to address their needs.</p1>
                <p></p>
                <p1>This voluntary work was a significant opportunity for me to communicate effectively, interact, and collaborate closely with individuals and groups from development organizations and local communities. During the needs assessment sessions, I engaged with community members to gather their feedback and insights, working together to determine the most effective ways to bring about positive change. This experience significantly contributed to my personal growth, enhancing my leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills. It made me more confident and comfortable discussing issues with people from diverse backgrounds. Overall, my time volunteering with these NGOs was a formative experience that helped me become more extroverted, talkative, and self-assured in my ability to impact the world positively.</p1>

                <h3>FIRST Global Challenge (FGC) Volunteering Experience</h3>
                <h4>My First FGC Experience: Flying Squad Member in Singapore (2023)</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>In 2023, I had the privilege of volunteering at the FIRST Global Challenge (FGC) in Singapore. As a member of the flying squad, I assisted numerous teams with their challenges, offering solutions to even the most complex problems. The rewarding experience of seeing teams leave the robot hospital with smiles on their faces, grateful for our help, was incredibly fulfilling. During the event, I not only taught students how to troubleshoot but also learned valuable lessons from other volunteers. For instance, Mr. Franky taught me to use heavy machinery and introduced me to a creative problem-solving technique using zip ties to fix a complicated gear issue, which later proved helpful in one of my university projects. The FGC experience was a two-way street; as much as I gave to the community, I received back in knowledge and camaraderie.</p1>
            </div>
                <h4>Returning to FGC: Applying for Robot Inspector (2024)</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>As I prepare for my second year in computer engineering at Queen's University, I'm also gearing up to relive the incredible experiences I had at FGC 2023. This year, I am applying for the position of Robot Inspector. Having enjoyed every part of being a flying squad member, I am eager to take on new challenges in the same technical field. Volunteering at FGC has become an integral part of my yearly schedule, and I find myself eagerly counting down the months, weeks, and days until the event. The sense of anticipation and excitement motivates me to contribute even more to this wonderful community.</p1>
            </div>
                <h4>Flying Squad and Beyond: A Yearly Tradition</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>The flying squad role was so fulfilling that I couldn't resist applying for it again. Helping teams in need reminded me of my time as a member of Team Palestine, where we faced significant challenges due to not receiving the kit. The flying squad team was always there for us, and now I aspire to be one of those heroes for other teams. Volunteering with FIRST has profoundly impacted my life, and I am committed to giving back to the community that has given me so much.</p1>
            </div>
                <h4>Why I Volunteer: The Impact of FIRST on My Life</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p>Volunteering at FIRST events has become a part of my life over the past three years. My journey began in 2022 as a student in Team Palestine, traveling to Switzerland. I then transitioned to an official coach for Team Palestine and joined Team W.A.F.F.L.E.S, a Canadian FRC team. In 2023, I volunteered at FGC in Singapore, where the gratitude and cultural exchanges with teams left a lasting impression on me. FIRST has expanded my network, made joining teams and clubs easier, and even contributed to my university scholarship. The sense of community, the exchange of knowledge, and the opportunities for personal growth keep me coming back to FIRST events. When I received the email about this year's event, I packed my bags, ready for another round of robots, challenges, friendships, and inspiration.</p>
            </div>
                <h4>Robotics Competitions: My Experience and Roles</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>In 2022, I participated as a student in Team Palestine, traveling to Switzerland for the competition. This experience ignited my passion for robotics and volunteering. In 2023, I volunteered at FGC in Singapore as part of the flying squad intake team. I also joined Team W.A.F.F.L.E.S, a Canadian FRC team, and continued coaching Team Palestine. In 2024, I maintained my roles as a mentor for Team W.A.F.F.L.E.S and a coach for Team Palestine. These experiences have allowed me to grow as a mentor and volunteer, continuously learning and contributing to the teams' successes.</p1>
            </div>
                <h4>Coaching Team Palestine: Bridging Distances</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>As a member and coach of Team Palestine, I remain actively involved despite living in Canada. I meet and coach the team in person during summer breaks, and throughout the year, I assist them with securing sponsors and obtaining necessary kits. This role allows me to maintain a strong connection with the team and contribute to their growth and development.</p1>
            </div>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <div class="first">
                <p1>Volunteering has been an incredibly rewarding journey, shaping my skills, perspectives, and personal growth. From working with NGOs to improve Palestinian communities' lives to engaging in the global robotics community through FIRST, each experience has left an indelible mark on me. As I continue my journey, I remain committed to giving back, learning, and making a positive impact on the world around me.</p1>
